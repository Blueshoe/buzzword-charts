# buzzword-charts

This repository contains the helm charts for the deployment of the buzzword-counter django app (https://github.com/Blueshoe/buzzword-counter).
It accompanies our blog post "Cloud Native Kubernetes Development", available at [Blueshoe (DE)](https://www.blueshoe.de/blog/kubernetes-development/) and [Unikube (EN)](https://unikube.io/blog/how-does-kubernetes-development-work/).

The charts uses the `helm secrets` plugin to encrypt secrets.
